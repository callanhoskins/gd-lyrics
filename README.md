# Grateful Dead Lyrics
A data-driven analysis of the Grateful Dead's lyrics. 

`data` contains the lyrics of songs performed by the Grateful Dead. The songs are organized into three categories: 
* `weir-barlow-lyrics`: songs written by barlow and performed by Bob Weir
* `garcia-hunter-lyrics`: songs written by Hunter and performed by Garcia
* `other-performed-lyrics`: songs performed by the GD but not written by Weir-Barlow or Hunter-Garcia

I found the lyrics [here](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mleone/dead-lyrics.html)
